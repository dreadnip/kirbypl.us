Title: Loot

----

Text: 

Each chest at the end of the run guarantees the GROUP two pieces of loot from the dungeon loot table - scaled to whatever item level is appropriate for the difficulty you completed the dungeon on (see table).

At the start of a week (after raid/mythic reset) a chest will appear in your order hall giving loot based on the highest level keystone dungeon COMPLETED the previous week, within the timer or not.

In addition, the chest will also have a downgraded keystone based on the highest level keystone run YOU COMPLETED in the previous week.

It is most beneficial to complete a +10 weekly to get the highest item level gear every reset. If that isn't feasible go for the next highest you can complete. Again, you don't need to finish in the timer to get the weekly chest.
