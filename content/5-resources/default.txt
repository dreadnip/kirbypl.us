### TIMERS

* GottaGoFast - All-in-one mythic+ timer. Shows % value of mobs on tooltip, timers required for +2/+3 chest and times that objectives are completed.
* Angry Keystones - Another take on the keystone/mythic+ timer. Displays affix rotation schedule and current affixes as well as providing chest timers and kill count % ingame. Also styles keystone links ingame to show you what dungeon they're for and whether they are depleted or not.
* MythicPlusProgress - Provides mob percent value toward the "Enemy Forces Eliminated" counter in tooltips and on nameplates.
* Keystone Expander - replaces text in [Mythic Keystone] links, showing information without having to see the tooltip
