Affixes: 

- 
  title: Bolstering
  level: 4
  difficulty: med
  description: "Non-boss enemies will buff nearby allies' health and damage when defeated with a 30yd effective range."
  note: "Note: it's important to kill all the trash in a pull as closely together as possible with this affix as mobs effectively heal as they gain max health (percent translation). If not careful on large trash pulls it's possible to create an unkillable mob by bolstering it a lot (SUPER CRAB). Adds spawned from a trash mob or boss ability do not trigger bolster. It's possible to reset bolster on mobs by resetting them via wiping or exiting combat."
- 
  title: Raging
  level: 4
  difficulty: med
  description: >
    Non-boss enemies will enrage at low
    health, dealing double damage until
    killed.
  note: "Note: mobs with high damage targeted abilities or high damage AoE abilities become deadly with this affix. Be sure to focus fire mobs down so there aren't multiple enraged mobs at once."
- 
  title: Sanguine
  level: 4
  difficulty: easy
  description: "Shortly after death, non-boss enemies will leave a pool of blood on the ground, which grows to a 5yd radius over 2 seconds. This pool heals enemies and damages players for a % of their maximum health. The pool's radius is 8 yds."
  note: "Note: ez pz affix, don't stand in pools and make sure mobs don't stand in them either."
- 
  title: Teeming
  level: 4
  difficulty: med
  description: >
    Additional non-boss enemies are present
    throughout the dungeon; kill count
    requirement increased.
  note: 'Note: many mobs, handle it. not much different from usual unless paired with a bad later affix. Most notable change with this affix is that the Enemy Forces Defeated kill requirement is increased. Certain trash pulls can be really nasty with this affix depending on the dungeon.'
- 
  title: Bursting
  level: 4
  difficulty: med
  description: 'When slain, non-boss enemies explode, causing all players to suffer 10% of their maximum health in damage over 4 seconds. This effect stacks.'
  note: "Note: Spread out and stay away from mobs as they're dying."
- 
  title: Necrotic
  level: 7
  difficulty: hard
  description: >
    Enemy melee attacks apply a stacking
    debuff that deals damage and reduces
    healing received. Debuff lasts 9
    seconds. This debuff now drops on
    exiting combat as of 2/21 hotfix.
  note: "Note: Strong AoE CC or slows are great for this affix to allow for kiting mobs while the tank's Necrotic stacks fall off."
- 
  title: Skittish
  level: 7
  difficulty: hard
  description: 'Tanks generate 75% less threat.'
  note: 'Note: This affix is a lot easier if Tricks of the Trade or Misdirection are used on cooldown. Strong AoE CC is beneficial here as well in case mobs get loose.'
- 
  title: Volcanic
  level: 7
  difficulty: easy
  description: >
    Enemies cause eruptions of flame beneath
    the feet of distant players. If there
    are no distant players, volcanoes will
    spawn under anyone randomly.
  note: 'Note: ez pz tier two affix. Volcanic may actually worked based on your distance from enemies vs. just checking if people are in range or not. Regardless, keep an eye out for the volcano animation under your feet.'
- 
  title: Fel Explosives
  level: 7
  difficulty: easy
  description: 'Creatures have a chance to summon an Explosive Orb at a nearby location that will explode, inflicting damage 50% of the player’s maximum health as damage.'
  note: 'Note: Similar to Volcanic. Make sure you keep an eye out for Orbs.'
- 
  title: Quaking
  level: 7
  difficulty: med
  description: 'Players will periodically Quake, inflicting 20% of the player’s maximum health as damage and interrupting spell casts of themselves and nearby allies.'
  note: No notes on this yet.
- 
  title: Grievous
  level: 7
  difficulty: med
  description: 'Note: While below 90% health, players are afflicted with Grievous Wound.'
  note: 'Note: You bleed until you are healed above 90%.'
- 
  title: Fortified
  level: 10
  difficulty: hard
  description: 'Non-bosses have more health and deal 30% more damage'
  note: 'Note: interrupting and dodging any/all trash mob abilities becomes an absolute priority with this affix (do this anyway :^) ). Most of the time spent in the dungeon will be fighting beefy trash so use DPS cooldowns on big trash pulls to speed things up.'
- 
  title: Tyrannical
  level: 10
  difficulty: easy
  description: 'Bosses have more health and deal 15% more damage.'
  note: 'Note: Boss abilities are no longer trivial. Boss mechanics need to be done or people will die. Some fights become endurance tests because they last so long. Bosses that are real assholes with Tyrannical: Advisor Melandrus, Shade of Xavius, Archdruid Glaidalis, etc'
