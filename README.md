# Kirbypl.us
m+ lame-o site, but now as a Kirby website

It's almost completely converted to a functional template, but I haven't found the time to integrate the calc (or the routes section).

I'd rate it at like 70% done?

The CSS is cleaned up though, and so is the JS. Responsive is kinda broken still, font size is wonky and the affix boxes don't display correctly.

## How to test

Clone or download, extract it, move inside the folder with a shell of choice and type

```
php -S localhost:8080
```

Then visit localhost:8080 to see the website and localhost:8080/panel to visit the back-end

I've included an account with "demo" & "demo" as the credentials for the panel.
